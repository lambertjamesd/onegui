# OneGUI

OneGUI aims to be a file format for creating consistent, flexible, and portable GUIs. Use the same tool to create your GUIs for any platform and any language with consistent results across each supported platform.

## OneGUI for programmers

OneGUI will be decoupled from any specific platform or language and will stay as simple as possible. Interacting with an OneGUI component may look something like this.

```
// this function will be called after a GUI is created but before it is displayed
// and allows you to setup GUI state and respond to events
function appCallback(appGui) {
    // set inputs on the GUI
    appGui.set('value1', 'value1-override');
    // listen for events
    appGui.set('onEvent', function(eventData) {
        appGui.set('value1', 'value1-newvalue');
    });
}

// gui components will have a default internal state but
// that state can be overriden with initialState
initialState = {param0: 'value0', param1: 'value1'};

// load the gui template
oneGui.loadTemplate('./app.onegui');

// - instantiate the template.
// - templates are stored by `namespace:name` when loaded 
//   and referenced by that name when instantiated
oneGui.instantiate('example:app', appCallback, initialState);

```

OneGUI aims to be a easy to implement gui spec to create consistent GUI renders across all platforms with a single easy to use WYSIWYG tool to generate the GUI files. The GUI will also not have any hard dependency on code nor will the code have a hard dependency on a GUI rather they will communucate via a simple interface exposing only the minimum data and callbacks needed to bind the GUI to the code. The goal is to make GUIs portable so a single tool will be useful for the web, desktop applications, mobile, and video games.

The GUI engine will be built on Web Assembly. Instead of having a standard for layout algorithms that each implementation would have to implement with regular updates and changes to layout features, OneGUI will just bundle layout logic as web assembly code that is generated by the WYSIWYG. This way implementations only need to implement a single algorithm once and it will be able to support various layout techniques making it forwards copmatible with the WYSIWYG or any other tool that wishes to compile to the OneGUI format.

Being built on Web Assembly, OneGUI files can bundle scripting logic with it for things such as validation, data conversion, and any other pieces of logic. This will allow for the creation of reusable and portable GUIs such as Date pickers where all the logic can be contained in the GUI with only minimal bindings to the host language.

Any function that is part of the standard library that can be implemented entirely in Web Assembly will be, such as a regular expression library or data validation.

OneGUI will be built with [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) but will try to maintain compatibilty with other languages
